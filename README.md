# Portfolio Project

This in my second official project as a Micronaut (Microverse Student). This repository was created to showcase new skills that I have learnt. 
This project was extremely challenging for me. Though, it enabled me to learn many new skills.

### The project concerntrates on the following topics:
* Working with a UI/UX Design Tool (I was able to parse a Figma design to create a UI for the first time).
* Working with Flexbox assist in placing elements in the page.
* Building a personal portfolio site.
* Using images and backgrounds to enhance the look of the website.
